    <h3>Ingredient</h3>
    <p>
        An ingredient has name, amount determined by an enum value, Nutrition value (see nutrition value on how it is made).
        <br/> If you want to fill in a value you need to select a type of weight and add the appropiate amount of it for the recipe.

<div>
    <h3>Nutrition Value</h3>
    <p>
        In order to fill in the total nutritional value for an ingredient a user needs to fill in the following properties:
        <br/>-Calories
        <br/>-Carbohydrates
        <br/>-Sodium
        <br/>-Protein

        <br/>A user does <b>not need</b> to fill in all the nutritional values because sometimes the data is not available for the user. However this means the recipe does not calculate the total nutritional values.
